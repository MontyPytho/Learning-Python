# LISTS -------------
# A list allows you to create a list of values and manipulate them
# Each value has an index with the first one starting at 0

# Made up of values with a unique key for each value
# Similar to lists, but you can't join dicts with a +

# CONDITIONALS -------------
# The if, else and elif statements are used to perform different
# actions based off of conditions
# Comparison Operators : ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

# The if statement will execute code if a condition is met
# White space is used to group blocks of code in Python
# Use the same number of proceeding spaces for blocks of code

# If the first matches it won't check other conditions that follow

    print('You are old enough to drive a tractor trailer')
elif age >= 16:

# You can combine conditions with logical operators
# Logical Operators : and, or, not
